# LES-SIMPAC-D-21-00145
Large Eddy Simulation (LES).
Create a engine model in any modeling software.
The model should contain cylinder, cylinder head, piston, intake and exhaust valves, intake and exhaust port.
Clean the engine model using STAR CCM+ 9.06 software without any errors of free edges, multiple edges, sharp pair of angles, self-intersection and shell orientation on cells.
Allocated a different parts with different shells.
Surface mesh the geometry in STAR CCM+.
Imported to STAR-CD es-ice module to generate volume mesh and moving mesh.
Set all the parameters for cold flow and combustion case and choose LES as a turbulence model.
Run the case.
Post process the results.
